A _measurement_ is a specific instance of a time series data point that references a _metric_.

A measurement consists of four attributes:

- **Metric** - Identifier of the metric that this measurement is about
- **Measure**  - Value of the time series
- **Timestamp** - Occurrence of the time series value
- **Source** - Label that identifies the specific instance the time series data point is about

### Getting Started
